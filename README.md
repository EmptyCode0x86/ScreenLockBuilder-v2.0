# ScreenLockBuilder-v2.0
 Screen Lock Builder v2.0 is a lightweight Windows utility that lets you generate a portable .exe file to lock the user's screen with your own message and rules.

You can customize the lock screen message, protect it with an encrypted password, and even define restrictions such as disabling Task Manager, blocking Command Prompt, or enabling auto-startup on system boot.

An optional auto-close feature allows the lock screen to automatically release at a specific date and time — giving you full control over when and how the lock behaves.

This project has a long history — the first version of Screen Lock Builder was released back in 2015, and version 2.0 brings a modernized and improved experience.
